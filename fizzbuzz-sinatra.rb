# OK, so we got ourselves comfortable with Sinatra, and the way he plays the songs we write. Thatâ€™s nice, our first web applications!
# Remember this moment :)

# Now I want you to think on a small web application with no UX at all and just a bit of interaction with a web client. You can do iterations
# on it so you add one feature at a time.

# Take a moment to read a bit of Sinatra documentation (test yourself!) and play with this tiny web framework. Use several routes, redirects,
# parameters and conditions.

# Go ahead! :D
