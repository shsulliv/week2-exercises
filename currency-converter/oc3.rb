# OC2. Money, money, money

# We were going back home yesterday. Second week, Monday, rain, new teacher... But just before getting into the subway, we found a bag full of
# money in different currencies! So we skipped TV shows for now (we’ll be back sometime, don’t worry!) because, don’t know why, we were
# suddenly interested in money.

# So we got to our local dealer, knowing that either way he will have a cut of the deal, but anyway we asked him about the current rates.
# And instead of using his services, we decided we wanted to get home, and write an awesome currency converter so we could know how much
# money was in the bag.

# Let’s do it now!

# You already have a little skeleton class with currency exchanges from and to €. Note that converting from/to € is direct, but if none
# of the from/to currencies is the € you have to do two conversions, using the € as a bridge.

# The only condition is: write ALL the tests first. Go full TDD on it. Yeah, all tests first. All of them. Yeah, every single one. Every.
# Single. One. Got it? One more time: every single one. And then, when everything is failing and so on... go implement it.

# Feel free to add support for your country currency! :)
