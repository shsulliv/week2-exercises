# Simple Calculator

## First Iteration

The goal of the first iteration was to build a simple, online calculator that allows the user to add, subtract and multiply two numbers. The calculator's homepage originally had form separate forms for addition, multiplication, subtraction, and division.

## Second Iteration

In the second iteration I condensed the homepage down to one form with four different buttons for addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. 

## Third Iteration

In the third iteration, I added a fifth button for saving the user's input data. When the user clicks the 'Sava Data' button, their saved data (written into a new file every time they perform a new math operation) is retrieved and appears in the first input box.
